Recently I completed Hyperlink Academy's Internet Homesteading course as part of the first cohort.

take some stuff from your substack about internet homesteading

Some thoughts:
As always, I found it challenging to let go of a need for my work to look right the first time.

I loved the course. It was awesome to work with fellow nerd interested in Internet homes. I'm fascinated by the indieweb and want to delve more into this space. I'm also obsessed wiht the idea of an internet home as a metaphor for physical space, but also being able to transcend physical space in strange, magical delightful ways. I would like to explore this more.

As someone fresh to the design work and still new to the professional world as a whole, I still get hung up on following rules (maybe guidelines is a better word). Like, because of the uncertainty of it all I fall back on things I learned, things I know to be true or typical, like searching for the ground when you dive into the water. With websites, this manifests as optimizing for SEO and wanting things to be perfect for recruiters and potential employers who come my way. But I'm committing to making this Internet home perfect for me. It is public-facing, so there will be things that I won't share, but it doesn't have to be *for the public*.

Moving forward, I commit to this home. I have laid the groundwork and now I need to build out the room. I won't put a timeframe on it and I'll be patient with myself when life gets busy, but I will continue to write here and add to my home, building it with love.
