    <h1>hi, I'm Bobbie üëãüèΩ</h1>
    <h2>what do you do?</h2>
    <p>I'm a product designer. currently building B2B SaaS software that empowers storage companies to optimize their operations. before that, I studied nanomaterials engineering at the University at Albany, SUNY.</p>
    <h2>but what do you do for fun?/h2>
    <p>I think I've wanted to design things on the Internet ever since my first Tumblr theme. Currently I work as a product designer for a software startup, but I'm also trying to figure out how to make money off writing and tweeting. tbh my interests are in a constant state of flux and change on a daily basis, but right now I am curious about our digital identities and ideas on what it means to be yourself on the Internet.</p>
    <h2>what does your grandma think you do?</h2>
    <p>Hi Oma, it's Ysabel. I make money by designing software. Kind of like all those apps you look at on your tablet. Yes, it's a real job. Yes, I get paid for it. I also write a lot about tech and hang out on the Internet.</p>
    <h2>where are you from?</h2>
    <p>I'm a Filipino-American, born and raised in New York. Three generations of my family immigrated to the US from the Philippines before I was born. My parents met here. My family's livelihood is nursing. My mom's a nurse. My aunts are nurses. My cousins are nurses. Weirdly, my dad became a lawyer and anthropologist. He was part of the constitutional review board for the Philippine constitution, after Ferdinand Marcos was unseated.</p>
